# flowsa

flowsa attributes resource use, waste, emissions, and loss to economic sectors. It produces standard tabular formats with
sector attribution data using pandas dataframes.

## Installation, Examples, Detailed Documentation
For installation instructions, example code, and further explanation of the code, see the [wiki](https://github.com/USEPA/flowsa/wiki).

## Terms

_flows_: represent the physical movement of material, energy, entities or money as input or output to or between activities.
The terms __flows__ comes from life cycle assessment (ISO 14044).

_sectors_: generally these are economic sectors generating economic activity, but are extended
here to include households and institutional end users. Using the BEA definitions in input-output
tables, these can be either _industries_ or _commodities_.

_attribution_: The sectors through which activity uses, produces or receives the flows (input or output).

## Flow Classes

Class | Description | FlowBySector Reference Unit | [Flow Types](./formatspecs/FlowBySector.md) |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
Chemicals | Chemicals and groups of chemicals as defined in the [Federal Elementary Flow List](https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List) | kg | Modeled as ELEMENTARY_FLOWS produced by sectors |
Employment | Jobs | p | Modeled as ELEMENTARY_FLOWS produced by sectors |
Energy | Energy consumption, transfer as electricity or waste heat  | MJ | All types |
Geological | Mineral and metal use | kg | All types |
Land | Land area occupied | m2 | Modeled as ELEMENTARY_FLOWS consumed by sectors |
Money | Purchases | USDyear* | Modeled as TECHNOSPHERE_FLOWS with producing and consuming sectors | 
Water | Water use and release data, including wastewater | kg | All types |
Other | Misc flows used for supporting data | _varies_ | All types |

*USD unit value varies by year and is reported like 'USD2012'

## FlowByActivity Datasets
 
Source data are imported and formatted into FlowByActivity datasets. The source data are only modified to meet column 
formatting criteria, meaning units are not standardized across "Class" types.

### FlowByActivity Naming Convention
Source dataset names are consistent across (1) the FlowByActivity dataset 'SourceName' columns, (2) the parquet file names,
(3) the Crosswalk file names, and (4) the Source Catalog information. Source names are comprised of two or three components.
The first part of the name is the agency that published the data. The second component is the name or acronym
of the published dataset. The third piece of the naming schema, if it exists, is the topic of data parsed from the 
original dataset. Of the four FlowByActivity datasets imported from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), three are
data pulled from the same dataset, the Census of Agriculture (CoA). To make data easier to find, the CoA data is separated 
by topic (Cropland, Livestock, Product Market Value). As the FlowByActivity datasets are grouped by topic, some of the 
parquets contain multiple class types, meaning the Class type should be specified when calling on the data. The
USDA_CoA_Cropland dataframe includes acreage information for crops (Class = Land) and the number of farms that grow a
particular crop (Class = Other). 

## FlowBySector Datasets
