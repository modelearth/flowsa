# Colabs

The first colab is based on [info from EPA on using Flowsa](https://model.earth/localsite/info/data/). 

You can edit online in our [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/modelearth/flowsa/blob/master/colabs/County%20Industry%20Data.ipynb) or upload a copy of the "County Industry Data.ipynb" file in this repo to your own colab drive.   


### Getting Started 

Go to [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/) and upload the .ipynb file in this folder.  

If you receive an error on the second step, remove the # in front of !pip in the first step.

### Pull for entire state, or pull county data

geographic_level='all' or geographic_level='county'

Note: BLS county data is incomplete because counties with only a couple firms only display the number of firms (no employee counts or payroles to protect anonymity.)
