## Term descriptions
- _sector-like_activities_: 
- _activity_schema_:
- _sector_aggregation_level_: 'aggregated' or 'disaggregated'. Some
        dataset crosswalks contain every level of relevant sectors (ex. NAICS 
        for 2-6 digits), that is they are fully disaggregated. Other datasets only 
        contain information for the highest relevant sector level, in which case, 
        the dataset is marked as showing aggregated sectors only 
        (ex. USGS_WU_Coef crosswalk)
